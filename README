# Fourier analysis of 2D curves

Playful exploration of Fourier analysis of closed curves in the 2D plane: any closed curve in the 2D plane can be approximated as a sum of rotating vectors.
Our inspiration is the elegant-as-always [exposition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6sGWTCMz2k&t=121s) by 3blue1brown.
The curve decomposition animations are done using [manim](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/index.html).
